### SQL Query

WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Top-level employees (no manager)
    SELECT 
        id, 
        employee_name, 
        manager_id, 
        0 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: Find employees who report to current level
    SELECT 
        e.id, 
        e.employee_name, 
        e.manager_id, 
        eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeHierarchy
ORDER BY level, id;
