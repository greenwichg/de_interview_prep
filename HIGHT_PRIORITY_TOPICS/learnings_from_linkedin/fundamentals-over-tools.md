# Master the Fundamentals Before the Tools

Before Snowflake, learn **SQL**.

Before Databricks, learn **Python**.

Before dbt, learn **Data Modeling**.

Too many people in data jump straight into the ✨ Shiny Tools Store — powered by hype and FOMO.

I remember when **Hadoop was "mandatory."**

Today? Barely mentioned.

Because tools are just **means**, not the **mission**.

They evolve every few years.

**Fundamentals don't.**

They compound over decades.

Get the basics right first.

The shiny tools? You'll pick them up faster than you think.

A Data Engineer strong in fundamentals:
- Adapts to any new stack.

A Data Engineer who only chases tools:
- Becomes irrelevant in a few years.

**Choose wisely.**
