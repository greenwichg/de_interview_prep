# My 12-Week Databricks Data Engineer Learning Plan (2026)

Over the last few weeks, I've been thinking a lot about how to upskill on Databricks without trying to learn everything at once. This is the 12-week plan I put together to stay focused and consistent.

## 🌈 Weeks 1–3 | Getting the Basics Right

- Understanding the Databricks Lakehouse and workspace
- Revisiting data engineering fundamentals (ETL vs ELT, medallion architecture)
- Strengthening Python for data engineering
- Brushing up SQL (joins, CTEs, window functions)

## 🌈 Weeks 4–6 | Spark & Delta Lake

- Apache Spark fundamentals (DataFrames, Spark SQL)
- How Spark actually executes jobs
- Delta Lake basics (ACID, schema enforcement, time travel)
- Batch ingestion and intro to streaming

## 🌈 Weeks 7–9 | Working on Databricks

- Notebooks, clusters, jobs, and workflows
- Auto Loader for scalable ingestion
- Delta Live Tables basics
- Spark performance tuning (partitioning, caching)

## 🌈 Weeks 10–12 | Thinking Production

- Building an end-to-end pipeline (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- Learning Unity Catalog for governance and access control
- Databricks SQL Warehouses and analytics
- Preparing for the Data Engineer Associate certification
